**177  Nth Highest Salary
Write a SQL query to get the nth highest salary from the Employee table.

+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
For example, given the above Employee table, the nth highest salary where n = 2 is 200. If there is no nth highest salary, then the query should return null.

+------------------------+
| getNthHighestSalary(2) |
+------------------------+
| 200                    |
+------------------------+

Solution


CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN
DECLARE M INT;
SET M = N-1;
  RETURN (
      # Write your MySQL query statement below.
      SELECT DISTINCT Salary
      FROM Employee
      ORDER BY Salary DESC
      LIMIT 1 OFFSET M
  );
END

# Salary:100,200,200,300,300,400
# ORDER BY DESC N Salary: 400, 300, 300, 200, 200, 100

# Limit 1  highest
# LIMIT OFFSETï¼ŒCOUNT
# OFFSET: specifies the offset of the first row to return
# COUNT: specifies the maximum number of row to return
